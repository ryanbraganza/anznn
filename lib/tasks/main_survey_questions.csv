0,0,Hospital,Registration hospital,Text,TRUE,,,,8,8,"Babies who received their entire care in a level II hospital or who were not transferred to a level III neonatal intensive care unit during the first 28 days are registered to the first level II centre that they remained in for 4 or more hours.  

If baby is transferred, she/he is considered to be in the next hospital from the time that the specialist retrieval team (NETS) arrives to collect her/him. 

If a baby is transferred from one level III hospital to another level III hospital and NETS arrives at or before 4 hours, then the baby belongs to the second level III hospital. Both hospitals should not provide data to the ANZNN. If there is any uncertainty, audit officers should contact the other hospital to clarify the situation.

If the baby dies within four hours, she/he is registered to unit where she/he dies.
