If the baby received supplemental oxygen after discharge from hospital, use the discharge date for the final day of respiratory support.

If the baby has respiratory support terminated but subsequently reinstated and the reason is fundamentally related to the initial perinatal respiratory illness, i.e. it is chronic lung disease and not an inter-current problem such as a viral infection, the date of final respiratory support should reflect this.

Do not include days of respiratory support for subsequent illnesses such as that required after surgery, RSV etc. If the baby requires respiratory support because of stridor secondary to subglottic stenosis which evolved as a consequence of intubation +/_ some chronic lung disease, regarding this as an extension of the initial respiratory illness is debatable. However, it is clearly a consequence of intubation related to the initial respiratory illness, and should be regarded as such. If the baby becomes oxygen dependent following RSV, this should be regarded as a consequence of the RSV + chronic lung disease, and excluded. If the baby is discharged on oxygen, this will be documented separately.","Date that supplemental oxygen, high flow, CPAP or mechanical ventilation was finally ceased for initial respiratory disease or as a consequence of complications of it.

Hence if the baby is receiving respiratory support for their initial and now chronic pulmonary disorder on the day before and the day after the baby turns 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, then record ""yes"".
The day the baby reaches 36 weeks' postmenstrual age is considered to be the infant's gestational age (completed weeks + days) plus chronological age in days. For example, a baby born at 28 weeks' and four days' gestation on January 1st, is 36 weeks' postmenstrual age on 22nd February.
