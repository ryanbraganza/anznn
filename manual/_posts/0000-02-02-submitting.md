## Submitting
Go to the 'Summary' page for the Data Entry Form you would like to submit. If you see a message in yellow up the top that says 'This data entry form is incomplete and can't be submitted.', then you will need to go in to any sections marked as 'Incomplete' and correct any problems.

Once you have done this, you will see  a 'Submit' button at the top. If you are sure that you have entered all the data, click 'Submit'. This will submit the record to ANZNN and you will no longer be able to edit it.
