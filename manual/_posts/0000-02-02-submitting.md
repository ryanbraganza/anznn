## Submitting
Go to the 'Summary' page for the Data Entry Form you would like to submit. If you see a message in yellow up the top that says 'This data entry form is incomplete and can't be submitted.', then you will need to go in to any sections marked as 'Incomplete' and correct any problems.

Once you have done this, you will see  a 'Submit' button at the top. If you are sure that you have entered all the data, click 'Submit'. This will submit the record to ANZNN and you will no longer be able to edit it.

## Submitting with warnings
If your data entry form has warnings, please check your answers carefully to ensure there are no mistakes. If you have checked and wish to submit with the warnings, this can be done by a user with 'Supervisor' level access.

If you do not have 'Supervisor' access, you will need to ask a supervisor to submit for you. If you are a 'Supervisor', you can submit the data entry form by clicking the '' button for the data entry form you wish to submit.
