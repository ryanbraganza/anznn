## Entering data
Next you will be shown the first page of the data entry form. The data entry form is divided up into sections to make it easier to answer. You're free to answer them when and how you like
* You can answer the questions in any order. 
* You don't need to answer them all right away - you can save a partially completed form and come back later to complete it.

### Answering
To help you answer the questions as easily as possible, context-sensitive help is shown on the right hand side. You can click on the question label or "info" icon to view the help for any question.

Grey text is also shown under many questions to help you understand the allowed values or to give hints on how to answer.

Questions that use radio button (see screenshot below for an example) can be answered by clicking either on the radio button itself, or on the text beside it.

### Navigating
At both the top and bottom you will see a series of boxes. Each of these is a section, and clicking on them will take you to that section, *and will also save your answers on the current page*. Use this if you want to jump to a specific section. The first box 'Summary' will take you to an overview page. The section you are currently on is highlighted in blue.

At the bottom there's three buttons
* *Save page* will save your answers on the current page and return you to the same page
* *Save and go to next section* will save your answers on the current page and take you to the next section. Use this if you want to work through the questions in order.
* *Cancel* will discard your changes on the current page and return you to a summary screen.

### Summary
At any time, you can view a summary of your progress. Click the first section link 'Summary' to view it. Clicking this will save your current answers.

The summary page shows you your progress on each of the sections, and you can click the 'Edit' link to go directly to any section.

### Errors and Warnings
Each time you save a page of answers, they will be validated against the ANZNN data requirements. Anything that has a problem is highlighted in red or orange.

* *Red* means the answer has an error and must be corrected. A message will tell you what the problem is. Any red errors must be corrected before your data can be submitted.
* *Orange* means the answer has a warning (e.g your answer is outside the usual range for the question). You should check these carefully to ensure you haven't made a mistake. Data entry forms can be submitted with warnings, but only by a user with "Supervisor" privileges.

## Reviewing Answers
At any time, you can review all of your current answers, including any errors or warnings. From the summary page, click the 'Review Answers' button. All your answers will be shown by section, with any errors or warnings. This allows you to quickly review everything on one page.
